# Node.js Authentication Boilerplate with Email Verification

A robust Node.js authentication boilerplate designed for secure user authentication with added email verification. This boilerplate provides a solid foundation for building web applications that require user registration, login, and account management features.

## Key Features:

- **User Authentication:** Implement secure user authentication using Node.js and Sequelize, providing a reliable foundation for user management.

- **Email Verification:** Enhance security and user confirmation by incorporating email verification during the registration process. Users receive a verification email with a unique link to activate their accounts.

- **Password Encryption:** Utilize strong password encryption techniques to safeguard user credentials and ensure data integrity.

- **Sequelize ORM:** Leverage the power of Sequelize as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool to interact seamlessly with your database, ensuring efficient data management.

- **Express.js Integration:** Built on top of Express.js, a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js, facilitating the development of scalable and maintainable applications.

- **Customizable and Extensible:** Easily extend the functionality to meet your specific requirements or integrate additional features with the modular and well-organized codebase.
